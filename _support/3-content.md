### Report abusive behavior

The Fielding Townsend App Centre strives to provide an environment where people can feel free to share their creativity. If abusive behavior happens, we want to make it easy for people to report it to us. Multiple apps can be included in the same report, helping us gain better context, while investigating the issues to get them resolved faster.


Note: For specifics about our abusive behavior policy, please read the [AppSplash Rules] (https://compliance.fieldingtownsend.com/appsplash) and [Terms of Service.] (https://compliance.fieldingtownsend.com/appsplash)


To report an application you need some information first:

*   The application's unique ID
*	The publisher's ID

You can find these in the apps **About This App** page.

When you have these details simply send us a message using the contact us form.
