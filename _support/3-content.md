### Report abusive behavior

The Fielding Townsend App Centre strives to provide an environment where people can feel free to share their creativity. If abusive behavior happens, we want to make it easy for people to report it to us. Multiple apps can be included in the same report, helping us gain better context, while investigating the issues to get them resolved faster.


Note: For specifics about our abusive behavior policy, please read the [AppSplash Rules] https://compliance.fieldingtownsend.com/appsplash and [Terms of Service.] https://compliance.fieldingtownsend.com/appsplash
