### About fake FTe emails

Fielding Townsend will only send you emails from @fieldingtownsend.com, @email.fieldingtownsend.com or @birchtownsend.co.uk However, some people may receive fake or suspicious emails that look like they were sent by Fielding Townsend. These emails might include malicious attachments or links to spam or phishing websites. Please know that we will never send emails with attachments or request your MyFTe password by email.

Legitimate support e-mails from FTe will always include a case number in the subject and are always sent from @fieldingtownsend.com addresses.
